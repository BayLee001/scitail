# Scitail
SciTail (Science Entailment) dataset and models

# Setup Instruction

1. Create the `scitail` environment using Anaconda

  ```
  conda create -n scitail python=3.6
  ```

2. Activate the environment

  ```
  source activate scitail
  ```

3. Install the requirements in the environment: 

  ```
  sh scripts/install_requirements.sh
  ```

4. Install pytorch as per instructions on <http://pytorch.org/>. Commands as of Nov. 22, 2017:

  Linux/Mac (no CUDA): `conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith`

  Linux   (with CUDA): `conda install pytorch torchvision cuda80 -c soumith`


6. Test installation by training an entailment model on subset of SNLI

 ```
 ```


# Train the models on SciTail dataset
TBD
